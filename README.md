ENAD (Evaluations Neuropsychologiques A Distance)

What is ENAD ?

ENAD is  a web application that allows doctors to send neuropsychological tests to  patients. While  patients perform the tests,  doctors see them in real time. ENAD is a telemedicine device for neurospychological diseases. Despite the distance, it helps doctors to make a better diagnosis for patients.

In addition, ENAD uses artificial intelligence to make the users experience better.

The 5 assessments are called :

*  figure complexe de Rey-Osterrieth;
*  trail making;
*  test de d√©nomination orale d'images;
*  batterie rapide d'efficience frontale;
*  mini mental state examination.

What is the future ?

Now, ENAD  helps doctors working on neuropsychological diseases but it is not enough.Our vision is to add more features to help every doctor to keep the job done despite the distance.
